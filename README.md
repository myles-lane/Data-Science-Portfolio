# Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files [(published at RPubs)](https://rpubs.com/mlane123).

# Contents

- ### Machine Learning
  * __Simple Linear Regression__
    * [ML using SLR:](https://github.com/myles-lane/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Simple-Linear-Regression.ipynb) Using simple linear regression to predict CO2 emissions of differernt cars.
  * __Decision Trees__
    * [ML using Decision Trees:](https://github.com/myles-lane/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Decision-Trees.ipynb) Using decision trees to build a model from historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then using the model to predict the right drug for a new patient.
  * __Support Vector Machines__
    * [ML using SVM:](https://github.com/myles-lane/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/SVM.ipynb) Using SVM (Support Vector Machines) to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.
  * __Reccomendations Systems
    * [Content-based System:](https://github.com/myles-lane/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Content-RecSys.ipynb) Implementing a simple reccomendation to suggest movies based on user ratings.

- ### Data Analysis and Visualization

- ### Micro Projects
  * __Python__
    * [ML using K Nearest Neighbors:](https://github.com/myles-lane/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Micro%20Projects/K-Nearest%20ML.ipynb) Using the KNN algorithm to classify whether a scale is leaning towards the left or right based on two points weight and distance from the center. Then using the elbow method to optimize the K value.
   
  * __R__
    * [ML using Logistic Regression:](https://rpubs.com/mlane123/micro_logistic) Using logistic regression to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes.
    * [ML using Linear Regression:](https://rpubs.com/mlane123/micro_linear) Using linear regression to predict individual medical costs billed by health insurance.
