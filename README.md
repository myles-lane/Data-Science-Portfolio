  * __Python__
    * [ML using K Nearest Neighbors:](https://github.com/myles-lane/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Micro%20Projects/K-Nearest%20ML.ipynb) Using the KNN algorithm to classify whether a scale is leaning towards the left or right based on two points weight and distance from the center. Then using the elbow method to optimize the K value.
   
  * __R__
    * [ML using Logistic Regression:](https://rpubs.com/mlane123/micro_logistic) Using logistic regression to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes.
    * [ML using Linear Regression:](https://rpubs.com/mlane123/micro_linear) Using linear regression to predict individual medical costs billed by health insurance.
